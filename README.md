# Supercharged-Surveillance-System
A smart security system for household made using Python.

Today everyone faces the problem of intruders and many outsiders are entertained in the premises, which can make harm to them and can damage their property.

The purpose of this project is to successfully develop a system that will recognize the human faces of the residential members and as well as for the outsiders, detect unwanted movements and based on all these this system will issue an alert and send sms message to the owner in real-time. The walls of our boundaries are not that safe, our model detects any intruder penetrating the walls and as detected an alarm is raised to stop the intruder and make aware to the residential members. The application provides interesting features that improve the overall security of the residential society.
